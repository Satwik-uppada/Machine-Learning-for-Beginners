what if we are having continuous features in data? which one we need to use either naive bayes, normal distribution?
we need to assume that they are in normal distribution .... check using shapiro test 
If it is not following normal distribution we need to transform them using boxcox, log, power transformation techniques

what are the consideration you need to see before using naive bayes?
1. features should be independent to each other
2. If it is categorical features then it is best to use navie bayes
3. If we have numeric features then we need to assume it is following normal distribution or not 
4. do shapiro test then if it is not normal distribution then use box cox transformation,power, to convert it
5. if it is still doesnot work then we cant use navie bayes.


fequentist approach -- more relie on data(interms of data)
bayes approach -- you cannot draw probability from data every time -- data and perception(knowledge)

prior idea(perception/domain knowledge) -- that what exactly i know --> sun rises from west
data -- sun rises from east -- posterior --updated with data --> combined with the knowledge


while using naive bayes we always want to findout p(y=1|x)
